<p style="color: purple;"> Marilyn Monroe, a timeless icon of beauty, grace, and strength, captivated the world with her unique blend of vulnerability and magnetism. </br> Her magnetic presence on screen and her ability to transcend the era in which she lived cemented her as a beloved cultural figure.</br> Marilyn was more than just a Hollywood star; she was a symbol of freedom and complexity, whose influence continues to resonate. </br>Tragically, her life was cut short, leaving the world to mourn the loss of someone whose brilliance could have shone for generations to come. Her legacy, however, remains eternal.</p>
<p2 style="color: purple;" > Marilyn lives on forever through her timeless films and the radiant smile that continues to inspire. Nearly a century later, she still brings hope, her smile glowing like the moon—reflecting the warmth of the sun that she once was. But more than that, she was a shooting star—leaving an indelible mark on the world and granting wishes to those who needed them most. If there is a heaven, I believe she now rests there in peace, free from the burdens and heartache she faced in a world that never truly understood her. </p2>
